# Caesar Cipher Decipher

## Description
A program to automatically decrypt Caesar cipher encrypted text using dictionary-based analysis.

## Problem Statement
Write a program that can decrypt Caesar cipher text without knowing the shift value by using dictionary-based analysis.

### Input Format
- Single string of encrypted text
- May contain capitalization and punctuation
- Words separated by non-alphabetical characters

### Output Format
- Decrypted text with preserved formatting
- Maintained capitalization and punctuation

### Constraints
1. No cryptographic libraries
2. Dictionary-based analysis required
3. Preserve non-alphabetical characters
4. Maintain original capitalization

## Scoring Criteria
- Correct shift identification
- Dictionary matching must achieve >85% accuracy
- Handle inputs up to 10,000 characters
- Support both single-word and full-text decryption
- Include frequency analysis as backup method
- Proper capitalization preservation
- Punctuation and spacing preservation
- No use of artificial intelligence or machine learning algorithms should be involved in the creation of your program
