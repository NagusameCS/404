# Program Interpretation Challenge

## Description
Create a detailed analysis of what a given program does by interpreting its code and behavior.

## Problem Statement
Given a program (in any language), provide a comprehensive explanation of its functionality, inputs, outputs, and behavioral patterns.

### Requirements
- Function flow analysis
- Variable usage tracking
- Algorithm identification
- Side effect detection
- Documentation generation

### Constraints
1. No program execution allowed
2. Manual analysis only
3. Must explain security implications
4. Document all edge cases

## Input Format
```json
{
  "program": "source_code_here",
  "language": "python",
  "analysis_requirements": [
    "security",
    "performance",
    "algorithm",
    "data_flow"
  ]
}
```

## Output Format
```json
{
  "main_purpose": "Program performs matrix multiplication",
  "algorithms_used": [
    "Strassen's algorithm",
    "Cache optimization"
  ],
  "data_flow": [
    "inputs": ["matrix A", "matrix B"],
    "transformations": ["split", "multiply", "combine"],
    "outputs": ["result matrix"]
  ],
  "security_concerns": [
    "Unbounded memory usage",
    "No input validation"
  ],
  "complexity": {
    "time": "O(n^2.807)",
    "space": "O(n^2)"
  }
}
```

## Test Cases
1. Basic Function:
   ```python
   def mystery(x, y):
       return x * y if y else x
   Expected Analysis: "Multiplication with null check safeguard"
   ```

2. Complex Algorithm:
   ```python
   # Recursive pattern with memoization
   Expected Analysis: "Dynamic programming solution for..."
   ```
