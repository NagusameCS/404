# Program Analysis and Understanding

## Description
Analyze and explain obfuscated code by breaking down its actual functionality and purpose.

## Problem Statement
Given an obfuscated program, provide a clear explanation of what the program actually does, including its true purpose, inputs, outputs, and algorithms used.

### Requirements
- Pattern identification
- Algorithm recognition
- Control flow mapping
- Hidden functionality detection
- Security implication analysis

### Constraints
1. No automated deobfuscation tools
2. Manual analysis only
3. Must document all findings
4. Identify potential malicious behavior

## Success Criteria

- Submit the deobvuscated code
- No use of artificial intelligence or machine learning algorithms should be involved in the creation of your program
