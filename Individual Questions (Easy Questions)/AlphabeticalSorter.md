# Alphabetical Sorter

## Description
Create a alphabetical sorting system that can sort based on the start or end of a word, in the least time and complexity possible, scoring will be determined by those metrics

## Problem Statement
Implement a sorting system that can take in either a string or array (or its corresponding equivalent for languages which do not use those types) and based on the start or end of a word organize them in alphabetical order

### Requirements
- Multi-datatype support

### Constraints
1. No built-in sort functions
2. Support multiple datatypes
3. No use of AI/ML
4. You may use language specific doccumentation



## Success Criteria
- The program must sort words alphabetically based on either the first or last character of each word.
- The output must be consistent and follow standard lexicographical order (A–Z).
- The solution must detect and handle both strings and arrays/lists correctly.
- The program must support sorting based on either the start or end character of each word, depending on a flag or input setting.
- No use of built-in sorting functions (e.g., sort(), sorted(), Arrays.sort()).
- A custom sorting algorithm (e.g., bubble sort, selection sort, merge sort) must be implemented.
- Time and space complexity should be kept as low as reasonably possible.
- Submissions will be scored based on the speed and memory efficiency of the implemented algorithm.
- Code must be well-structured, readable, and follow best practices for the chosen language.
- Variable names should be meaningful.
- The program should include basic error checking and handle edge cases (e.g., empty input, single-word input, mixed capitalization).
- For string input → output should be space-separated sorted string
- For array input → output should be sorted array/list
- No use of artificial intelligence or machine learning algorithms should be involved in the creation of your program
