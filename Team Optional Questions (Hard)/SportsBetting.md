# Sports Betting Analysis

## Description
Create a data analysis system for sports betting predictions and outcome analysis.

## Problem Statement
Develop a program that analyzes historical sports data to identify betting patterns and calculate probabilities.

### Requirements
- Historical data analysis
- Probability calculation
- Pattern recognition
- Win/loss ratio tracking
- ROI calculations

### Constraints
1. No real-time data feeds required
2. Must use statistical analysis only
3. No external APIs
4. Process data in CSV/JSON format

## Data Format
```json
{
  "event": "NBA_Game_123",
  "teams": {
    "home": "Lakers",
    "away": "Celtics"
  },
  "odds": {
    "moneyline": {"home": +150, "away": -130},
    "spread": {"home": +3.5, "away": -3.5},
    "total": 220.5
  },
  "historical_data": [
    // Previous meetings, team statistics, etc.
  ]
}
```

## Expected Outputs
```json
{
  "prediction": {
    "winner": "Lakers",
    "confidence": 0.73,
    "recommended_bet": "moneyline",
    "risk_assessment": "medium",
    "expected_value": "+2.3 units"
  }
}
```

## Performance Metrics
1. Prediction Accuracy: >60%
2. ROI calculation: Â±2% margin of error
3. Processing time: <5s per event
4. Risk Assessment Accuracy: >70%

## Test Scenarios
1. Standard Game:
   - Input: Regular season NBA game
   - Expected: Complete analysis with confidence >65%

2. Special Event:
   - Input: Playoff game with injured star player
   - Expected: Adjusted odds and lower confidence rating
